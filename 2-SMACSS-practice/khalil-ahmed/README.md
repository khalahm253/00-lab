##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I put all the single element selectors into base.css I placed all ID's and classes into layout.css I placed everything that was neither a class, ID, single element selector, or animation and focused on multiple element selectors to move to modules.css.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No. Just the order of style sheets according to the 'Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS' reading.
